<p>I got into coding about 3 years ago and since then I just couldn't stop. I'm really grateful to work with something I am passionate about.
</p>
<p>My goal is to learn new things everyday and what keeps me passionate about tech is that there is always something new to learn.
</p>
<p>Currently I am studying Node.js and Rest Api architecture.
